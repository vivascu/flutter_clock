# Digital Clock

This app is based on the flutter example of a digital clock.
It purely serves an aesthetic purpose.

_This version (incomplete as it is) has been submitted to the [#FlutterClock](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlutterClock) challenge._


## Description

For this variation the digits in the clock are represented regular polygons.
The following rules apply for digits:

- __0__ is represented by an empty circle.
- __1__ is represented by an filled circle.
- __2__ is represented by a line.
- __3-9__ are represented by regular polygons which have the number of sides equal to the digit.
- __The second digit on the dial__ is always filled with a color depending on the digit.
- __The third digit on the dial__ is always drawn in red with a thin stroke.
- __The fourth digit on the dial__ is always drawn with a stroke with a color depending on the digit.

## Example

In the following screenshot the clock is displaying time __*13:48*__
